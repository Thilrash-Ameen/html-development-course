# HTML Links

_Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page._

## HTML Links - Hyperlinks

_HTML links are hyperlinks. You can click on a link and jump to another document. When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand._

_<strong>Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!</strong>_

_By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:_

- An unvisited link is underlined and blue
- A visited link is underlined and purple
- An active link is underlined and red

## HTML Links - The target Attribute

_\_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked_
_\_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab_
_\_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame_
_\_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window_

## Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs

_Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute. A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part)_
